This is a modified version of the [ChangeDistiller](https://bitbucket.org/sealuzh/tools-changedistiller/wiki/Home) tool. 

The main changes revolved around making the original code work with in-memory representation of the code rather than requiring physical files to be present on the file-system.

In addition, a number of modifications were introduced to enhance change reporting (e.g., test method detection).

Kudos to the [S.E.A.L team @ UZH](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal.html) for making this great tool available, and as production ready as it is.
